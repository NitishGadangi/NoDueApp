<h2>NoDueApp for JNTUH CEH Students</h2>
This app is helpful to the students of JNTUH CEH, who wanted to know their Semester Exam Results without clearing Mess and Hostel Dues.<br>
This App is based on the Algorithm developed by me, which basically decodes the direct URL to the Result of given Roll No. based on Memo number.
It consists of Qr Scanner built in which is helpful in recognizing the Memo number of any given Memo.
<br>
So, anyone who is unable to check their examination result can directly know their result prior to the clearing dues.


<h4>Steps to check your examination result:</h4>
1.Open the app.<br>
2.Read the instructions carefully and click proceed.<br>
3.Read about the prerequisites required and click scan.<br>
4.Scan the Qr code on the Memo.<br>
5.Enter you Roll number and click on check result.<br>
6.Congratulations,your exam result is out now.<br>
<br>
<h4>Further development to this app might not be assured.So,the algorithm can get abondened at any instant.</h4>
